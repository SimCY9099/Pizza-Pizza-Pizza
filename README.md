# Pizza-Pizza-Pizza - A pizza sales analysis 
## Project Purpose:
### The purpose of this project is to  help the pizza shop to better understand their customers, identify areas where they can improve their business, and improve their business by providing them with insights into their customers and their sales data.

## Date:
### Obtain from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shilongzhuang/pizza-sales) but originally from [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/blog/maven-pizza-challenge). The datset in Kaggle has been cleaned and combine multiple dataset as one.

## Guiding question to briefly analyze the project:
### 1. What days and times do we tend to be busiest?
### 2. How many pizzas are we making during peak periods?
### 3. What are our best and worst-selling pizzas?
### 4. What's our average order value?
### 5. How well are we utilizing our seating capacity? (we have 15 tables and 60 seats)

## Statistical Analysis:
### The average, total, maximum and minimum revenue for week day and table turnover rate is calculated in this project.

## Conclution: 
### The results of the pizza sales analysis project have shown that the busiest days for pizza sales are Thursday, Friday and Saturday, with the busiest time of day being between 12pm and 1pm. The best selling pizza is the Classic Deluxe Pizza, followed by the BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Hawaiian Pizza. The table turnover rate are mostly over 3, which indicate the customers are not spending longer time in the pizza place.
### These findings can be used by the pizza shop to improve their business. For example, the shop might want to consider hiring more staff on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights to cope with the increased demand. They might also want to consider offering discounts for early dining or table sharing to increase the table turnover rate.
### Overall, the pizza sales analysis project has provided the pizza shop with valuable insights into their customers and their sales data. These insights can be used to improve the business and make it more profitable.

## Suggestion:
### - Hire more staff on Thursday, Friday and Saturday lunch. This would help to ensure that the shop is able to cope with the increased demand during these busy days.
### - Offer discounts for early dining or table sharing. This would encourage customers to eat their meals earlier and leave the restaurant sooner, which would help to increase the table turnover rate and revenue.
### - Promote the pizza shop on social media. This would help to reach a wider audience and attract new customers.
### - Improve the customer experience. This could be done by providing better customer service, offering a more comfortable dining environment, or adding new menu items.
